<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a master coach, best-selling author and a passionate speaker. 
  I’m the founder of the first women-only hedge fund, special counsellor in many corporations 
  across the globe. I’ve found balance between work and life, now I’m a totally happy person, 
  loving mother, inspiring speaker and writer, and firm investor, but it didn’t come easily. 
  I've gone though hundreds of failures and complicated situations. You can use my previous 
  experience in order not to fall into the same trap.</p>

<p>In 2008, I wrote my first book Success Yourself, and it was a real success, forgive me the wordiness.
  My upcoming book Inflated Expectations: Free Yourself from Your Past, Live Your Present and Get the
  Future You Want is the guidebook for how to treat disappointment on the emotional, mental, behavioral 
  and spiritual levels.</p>

<p>Today, I support ordinary people in answering the questions: “Who Am I, What do I want, and How do I get it?” 
  I am a master coach combining life coaching with the principles of behavior psychology. I'm totally 
  passionate about supporting people out of suffering and limitation and into fulfillment. </p>
